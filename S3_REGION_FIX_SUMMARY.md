# S3 Region Configuration Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
- **Problem**: S3 bucket 'employeedocs' is located in region **us-west-2**
- **Current Setting**: AWS_REGION environment variable is set to **us-east-1**
- **Result**: Region mismatch causing "PermanentRedirect" errors

## Automatic Fix Applied
✅ The S3 service (`server/services/s3Service.ts`) has **automatically detected and corrected** the region mismatch:
- The service detected the bucket is in `us-west-2`
- It automatically reinitialized the S3 client with the correct region
- The application is now using the correct region for S3 operations

## Current Status
1. **Region Issue: RESOLVED** ✅
   - The S3 service is now correctly configured for us-west-2
   - Automatic region detection is working as designed

2. **Remaining Issue: IAM Permissions** ⚠️
   - There's an "Access Denied" error even with the correct region
   - This is a separate IAM permissions issue that needs to be addressed

## Recommended Actions

### 1. Update Environment Variable (Performance Optimization)
While the automatic detection works, for optimal performance:
- Update `AWS_REGION` to `us-west-2` in Replit Secrets panel
- This will prevent the need for automatic detection on each restart

### 2. Fix IAM Permissions (Required for Full Functionality)
The AWS credentials need proper permissions for the 'employeedocs' bucket:
- Verify IAM user has S3 permissions for the bucket in us-west-2
- Required permissions: `s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject`, `s3:DeleteObject`, `s3:ListBucket`

## Test Results
```
✅ Region Detection: Successful
✅ Client Reinitialization: Successful  
⚠️ Bucket Access: Access Denied (IAM issue)
```

## Technical Details
The S3 service includes robust error handling:
- Automatic region detection via PermanentRedirect response headers
- Retry logic with correct region
- Fallback to local storage when S3 is unavailable
- Proper logging of issues and recommendations

The service will continue to work with local storage fallback until IAM permissions are fixed.
