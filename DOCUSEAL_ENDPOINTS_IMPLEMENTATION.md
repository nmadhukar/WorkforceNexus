# DocuSeal Backend Endpoints Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented three new API endpoints for the DocuSeal signing queue and signer-specific actions. These endpoints provide comprehensive document signing management capabilities with proper authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.

## Implementation Details

### 1. DocuSealService Extensions
Added two new methods to `server/services/docusealService.ts`:

#### `getSigningUrl(submissionId: string, signerEmail: string)`
- Fetches submission details from DocuSeal API
- Finds the specific signer by email address
- Generates a fresh signing URL for that signer
- Returns null if signer not found

#### `sendReminder(submissionId: string, signerEmail?: string)`
- Sends reminder emails via DocuSeal API
- Supports targeted reminders to specific signers or all pending signers
- Updates reminder tracking in the database
- Returns success/failure status with message

### 2. API Endpoints

#### GET `/api/forms/signing-queue`
**Purpose**: Retrieve signing queue for an employee with full party/signer details

**Query Parameters**:
- `employeeId` (required): The employee ID to query
- `includeParties` (optional): Boolean flag to include party details

**Authentication**: 
- HR/Admin can query any employeeId
- Employees can only query their own signing queue

**Response Structure**:
```json
[
  {
    "submissionId": "docuseal-uuid",
    "templateName": "Employment Agreement",
    "createdAt": "2025-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
    "status": "pending",
    "parties": [
      {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john.doe@example.com",
        "role": "employee",
        "status": "sent",
        "sentAt": "2025-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
        "openedAt": null,
        "completedAt": null
      },
      {
        "name": "HR Department",
        "email": "hr@example.com",
        "role": "hr",
        "status": "pending",
        "sentAt": "2025-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
        "openedAt": null,
        "completedAt": null
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

**Key Features**:
- Filters out completed, cancelled, and expired submissions
- Fetches real-time party details from DocuSeal API when available
- Falls back to database information if DocuSeal is not configured
- Includes comprehensive audit logging

#### GET `/api/forms/submissions/:id/sign`
**Purpose**: Get signing URL for a specific signer (enhanced from existing endpoint)

**Path Parameters**:
- `:id`: The submission ID

**Query Parameters**:
- `signer` (optional): Email address of the specific signer

**Authentication**:
- Employees can only get their own signing URL
- HR/Admin can get any signer's URL

**Response Structure**:
```json
{
  "signingUrl": "https://docuseal.co/s/submitter-id",
  "submissionId": 123,
  "status": "pending",
  "employeeId": 456,
  "signerEmail": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

**Key Features**:
- Generates fresh signing URLs on demand (not persisted)
- Supports both legacy mode (without signer param) and new mode (with signer param)
- Comprehensive audit logging for all signing URL requests
- Proper error handling for DocuSeal service availability

#### POST `/api/forms/submissions/:id/remind`
**Purpose**: Send reminder emails to signers

**Path Parameters**:
- `:id`: The submission ID

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "signerEmail": "john.doe@example.com"  // Optional
}
```

**Authentication**: HR/Admin only

**Response Structure**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Reminder sent to john.doe@example.com",
  "submissionId": 123,
  "remindersSent": 2
}
```

**Rate Limiting**:
- Maximum 1 reminder per submission per hour
- Implemented using Express rate-limit middleware
- Additional database-level tracking for rate limiting

**Key Features**:
- Supports targeted reminders to specific signers
- Sends reminders to all pending signers if no email specified
- Updates reminder tracking in database
- Comprehensive error handling for completed/expired submissions
- Audit logging for all reminder requests

## Security & Compliance

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Employees**: Can only access their own signing queue and signing URLs
- **HR/Admin**: Full access to all employees' signing queues and can send reminders
- Strict permission checking at every endpoint

### Audit Logging
All endpoints include comprehensive audit logging:
- Who accessed signing URLs
- Who requested reminders
- Which employees' data was accessed
- Timestamp and action details

### Error Handling
Proper error responses for all scenarios:
- 400: Bad request (missing parameters, invalid submission state)
- 401: Authentication required
- 403: Insufficient permissions
- 404: Resource not found
- 429: Too many requests (rate limiting)
- 500: Internal server error
- 503: Service unavailable (DocuSeal not configured)

## Integration with Existing System

The implementation seamlessly integrates with:
- Existing authentication system (session-based)
- Existing DocuSealService configuration
- Existing form submission database schema
- Existing audit logging system
- Existing role-based access control

## Handling DocuSeal Service Availability

All endpoints gracefully handle scenarios where DocuSeal is not configured:
- Signing queue falls back to database information
- Signing URL generation returns appropriate error messages
- Reminder sending returns service unavailable status

## Testing

Created comprehensive test script (`test_docuseal_endpoints.js`) that verifies:
- Endpoint availability and structure
- Authentication requirements
- Permission checking
- Rate limiting functionality
- Error handling

## Usage Examples

### Getting an Employee's Signing Queue
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/forms/signing-queue?employeeId=1&includeParties=true" \
  -H "Cookie: connect.sid=..."
```

### Getting a Specific Signer's URL
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/forms/submissions/123/sign?signer=john.doe@example.com" \
  -H "Cookie: connect.sid=..."
```

### Sending a Reminder
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/api/forms/submissions/123/remind" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: connect.sid=..." \
  -d '{"signerEmail": "john.doe@example.com"}'
```

## Files Modified
