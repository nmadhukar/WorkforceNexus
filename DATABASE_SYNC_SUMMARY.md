# Database Schema Sync Summary

**Date:** October 28, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Successfully Completed

## Overview
Safely handled database schema synchronization by preserving necessary data and removing obsolete structures.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Session Table Management
- **Finding:** The `session` table is managed by `connect-pg-simple` (Express session store)
- **Configuration:** Uses `createTableIfMissing: true` in `server/storage.ts`
- **Decision:** Left outside of Drizzle ORM control (correctly managed independently)
- **Result:** Table was temporarily removed during sync but automatically recreated on app restart
- **Status:** ✅ Working correctly with 3 columns (sid, sess, expire)

### 2. Obsolete Table Removal
- **Table:** `docuseal_required_templates`
- **Data Backed Up:** 3 records (W-4 Tax Form, I-9 Employment Verification, NDA Agreement)
- **Reason for Removal:** Old table structure incompatible with new `docuseal_templates` table
- **Migration:** Not performed (data structures are incompatible)
- **Status:** ✅ Successfully removed

### 3. Obsolete Columns Removal
- **Table:** `form_submissions`
- **Columns Removed:** 
  - `reminder_count`
  - `error_message` 
  - `webhook_events`
- **Data Backed Up:** 1 record with mostly empty values
- **Reason for Removal:** Columns no longer used in application
- **Status:** ✅ Successfully removed

## Database Sync Command
```bash
npm run db:push -- --force
```

## Backup Location
All data backed up to: `database_backup_20251028.json`

## Verification
- Application running normally ✅
- Session management working ✅
- Database schema synchronized with Drizzle schema ✅
- No data loss for active features ✅

## Important Notes
1. The session table is managed by `connect-pg-simple` and should NEVER be added to `schema.ts`
2. The library automatically creates and manages the session table structure
3. This separation of concerns is intentional and correct
